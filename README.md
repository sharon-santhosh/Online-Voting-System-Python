Application Overview:

This Online Voting System is a fully featured polling app. The entire application was developed using the Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python. This system has a login page where the users and the admin can enter their username and password to log in. There is also a registration page for new users. The application will allow the admin to start a poll, edit existing polls, delete the polls, and end the poll. The users will be able to vote based on their priorities. The system also allows the polls to be sorted based on their date of creation, the total number of votes, and alphabetical order. 

Problem Statement:

Recently, the Online Voting System has been studied by a lot of developers. It has been a part of active research for many years now. Although itâ€™s a developing topic, there have been quite some challenges in the development of real-world solutions to the online voting system. One of the most common issues is the safety of the system. As some of these voting systems contain the personal data of the people, there have been some complications of data breaches and identity theft. The insecure use of the web application along with the internet is also one of the main challenges in this system. All these concerns and challenges must be rectified in order to instill trust in the minds of the public.

Problem Solution:

The Online Voting System that is developed will be an easy-to-use web application that will make the public feel comfortable to participate. The system will also not gather any kind of critical information from the public and this will make it safer to use. The entire voting system will be automated. This means that the system will be both cost and time-effective. The system will also give us an instant poll result that will be unbiased. All the votes will be automatically counted and the results can be seen instantly.
